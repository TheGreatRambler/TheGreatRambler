### Welcome to my page!

I'm TheGreatRambler, a guy interested in the very techy and nerdy. Expect most of my projects to be modifying a game in some way. I have experience in many different fields of study but, as a teen, have not yet been employed. I hope you will check out some of my work. My main languages are **CPP** and **JS**.
